I am a fourth-year (2020 - Present) Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Nitesh Chawla](https://niteshchawla.nd.edu/), ACM/IEEE/AAAI Fellow. Before that, I received my B.Ec. degree from [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie broadly in machine learning and data mining, with a focus on graph neural networks. More specifically, I work on developing graph neural networks that can effectively handle data imbalance and data sparsity on graphs. Additionally, I also apply machine learning to advance interdisciplinary studies, such as AI for Chemistry and COVID-19 forecasting.
